# Capstone Project 2: Online Store with Shopping Cart

## Description 

This is the project I completed for my second capstone project in Level 1 Task 15. The project is an online store that sells vinyl
records. The store also contains a functional shopping cart. The store is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and utilises all the skills
I acquired upon completing the tasks in level 1.
